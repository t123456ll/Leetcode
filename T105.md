## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

### Problem

Medium

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### Solution

1. recursion

   what is preorder and inorder of a binary tree, click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/). 

   Reference is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/discuss/34579/Python-short-recursive-solution.).

   Because inorder tervasal is an order you need to visit left part of tree, then the root node and finally the right part of tree. So when you find the root val in the inorder list, you will observe that numbers before root are all its left part, and number after it are all right part.

   For each recursion, you need to find root first and divide inorder list into two parts, the left part and the right part.

### Final code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        if inorder:
            ind = preorder.pop(0) #pop(index=0) pop the first num
            idx = inorder.index(ind)
            root = TreeNode(ind)
            root.left = self.buildTree(preorder, inorder[:idx])
            root.right = self.buildTree(preorder, inorder[idx+1:])
            return root
```
