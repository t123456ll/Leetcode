## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

### Problem:

Medium

Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?

### Solution:

1. two indexes, the distance between the slow one and the fast one is n. When fast one reaching to the end, the slow one point to the previous positon of deleted element.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast, slow = head, head
        while(n):
            n -= 1
            fast = fast.next
        if not fast: # the n is equal to the length of linked list
            return slow.next # delet the first element of linked list
        while(fast.next):
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        # at this time, slow at the previous position of deleted node
        
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
