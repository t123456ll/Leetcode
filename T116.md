## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

### Problem

Medium

You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}

Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}

Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
```

 

**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

### Solution

1. iteration

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left, right, next):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root: 
            return root
        q = deque()
        q.appendleft(root)
        while(q):
            l = len(q)-1
            cur = q.pop()
            if cur.left: q.appendleft(cur.left)
            if cur.right: q.appendleft(cur.right)
            for i in range(l):
                pre = cur
                cur = q.pop()
                pre.next = cur
                if cur.left: q.appendleft(cur.left)
                if cur.right: q.appendleft(cur.right)
            cur.next = None

        return root
```
