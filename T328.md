## 328. Odd Even Linked List

Medium

916241Share

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
```

**Note:**

- The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def oddEvenList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        cur = head
        count = 0
        if not head or not head.next: 
            return head
        even_head = head.next
        while cur.next:
            count += 1
            pre = cur
            cur = cur.next
            pre.next = cur.next
        if count%2: # cur at the end of even list
            pre.next = even_head
        else: # cur at the end of odd list
            cur.next = even_head
        return head
```
